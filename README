Hi. Here is the list of algorithmic problems from past ACM programming contests I solve just for fun. My statisticts can be found on 
http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/212676 and it's better to view this page with 
Firefox as it's displayed incorrectly in other browsers.

But I would expect you to try solving the problem first and then looking at the
solution.
